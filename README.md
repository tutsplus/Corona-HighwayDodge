Highway Dodge starts out by placing the player in a racecar on the highway. During the game, the player must dodge oncoming traffic on the highway by tapping on one of the three available lanes. For every dodged car, the player will receive 1 point and itâ€™s game over for the player when an oncoming car hits the racecar. Over time, the oncoming cars come out faster and faster, to a point, to provide a real challenge to the player. View a demo of this game at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VttQY5zOpi8.
